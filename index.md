### Tengwar Transcriber
[GitHub](https://github.com/thepython10110/tengwar-transcriber), [Demo](Tengwar-Transcriber)
A program that converts English into Lord of the Rings Elvish Tengwar. I'm unlikely to finish it, especially since [Tecendil](https://tecendil.com) already exists.

### Countdown
[GitHub](https://github.com/thepython10110/countdown)
A Python/Tkinter program that counts down the time until user-specified events, with the ability to make custom themes. It requires Python 3 on a Windows computer (although using it on other OS's shouldn't take much modification), and several Python modules that *should* automatically be installed. It saves either to a JSON file or to a [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) server via the REST API. It uses my Python script (`hass.py`) which has several functions that make the Home Assistant REST API relatively easy to use.

### Clonetron
[GitHub](https://thepython10110/clonetron)
Hopefully a [Minetest](https://minetest.net) mod that's a port of [Digtron](https://github.com/minetest-mods/digtron) for [MineClone](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2) It doesn't work, and I know basically nothing about the Minetest/MineClone API (?), and I'm also very new to Lua, so I don't know how to fix it. Basically, all I did was change the crafting recipes, change the dependencies, and find/replace "digtron" with "clonetron." *PLEASE* look through it and open an issue telling me how to fix it...
